In order to compile and run this project, start by pulling the source code from this repository.

Next, you will need to take care of the project dependencies. To do this, follow the url in the CREDIT file.
Follow the instructions on the referenced site to integrate Tesseract-OCR, Leptonica, and Tess-Two into the Android Studio project with the Android NDK.

Once the NDK integration is complete, make sure the dependencies are included in your Android Studio project so the IDE will know to reference them.

After this, the project should build fine and run on an emulator or connected device. I would highly recommend using a connected device as opposed to the emulator due to the nature of the project.
